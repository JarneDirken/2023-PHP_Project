## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

This was our first real team project. For this project we had to go to a real customer who had a real problem and try to solve it.

We needed to solve the problem of this cycling club that managed everything on paper. So first thing we did was make a plan on what for functionalities should be present.

After that we started working on our project. It was a real challenge but we did saw php and laravel earlier that year with smaller projects.

First we made the necessary functionalities like a working calendar, webshop and the basic cruds. Around this time I also tried to hosting. We also used a profile picture saver and a way to add images to the clothing you can add. These were some challenges we faced.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up the importance of teamwork and problem solving also PHP and laravel.

### 🧠 Brain:

-   **Problem solving**: First time using PHP and laravel was kind off complicated. Running everything on a virtual machine and so on was a struggle. Also working in a team of 6 does cause it's issues so problem solving was something that was continually happening.

### 📏 Team coordination:

-   **Working as a team**: Wokring as a team is very important, this project really helped me thinking about being in a team. This was the first real team project and helped me improve my team skills.

### ⌚ Time management:

-   **Using scrum board**: Keeping track of all our tasks using a scrum board really made everything organised. For this project we used Jira.

### 📓 New knowledge:

-   **Php**: First time using php which I was pretty happy about. This is also something used in WordPress which is something I want to get into further and with the basic knowledge of php is going to be a lot smoother in the future.
-   **Laravel**: First time using laravel and I learned a lot.
-   **Combell**: Everything needed to be hosted and I was in charge of that. We used combell for this project and I learned a lot about the interface.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

Each part of this project helped me understand more about building cruds, managing complex information for the statistics, and improving user experience. It was a fun experience that in the end really improved a lot of my skils.

## 💭 How can it be improved?
